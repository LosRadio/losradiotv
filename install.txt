OpenBroadcaster - Server Installation Instructions

These instructions are an alternative to using ob.installer.sh.

*** After install, set OB_UPDATES_USER and OB_UPDATES_PW in config.php and then run https://YOUR_IP/updates ***

Administrator login is no longer supported for OB updates since July 2020.

Note: When using special characters in the password, they need to use single quotes instead of double quotes when they echo the string 

1. See dependencies.txt for server dependencies.  Mostly PHP/MySQL related, but 
   a few things to support transcoding and media identification. 

2. Copy server files to a web environment (web document root).

3. Import db/dbclean.sql to a database.

4. Copy config.sample.php to config.php, and edit as necessary.

5. Ensure media storage directories are writable by the web server.

6. In the web document root, create 'assets' and 'assets/uploads' directories.  
   These directories should be writable by the web server.

7. The database import includes one user.  The username is admin.  The password
   must be updated:

   php tools/password_change.php admin newpassword

8. Log into OpenBroadcaster as admin, and access http://ob_install_url/updates/ to
   verify your installation and run any required updates.
